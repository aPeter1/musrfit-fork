changes since 0.8.0
===================================
NEW extended global mode in msr2data
NEW any2many: an attempt to write the universial musr-data-file converter. Just started, needs still some work.
NEW musrt0: added the possibility to show the t0 saved in the data file 's'. Furthermore added the option
    --getT0FromPromptPeak, -g with <firstGoodBinOffset>: will, in non-interactive mode estimate the t0's from 
    the prompt peak and write it into the msr-file (MUSR-133).
FIXED various bugs in msr2data
FIXED 2 little annoying problems: (i) now it is possible to zoom down to the single bin in musrview. 
     (ii) when switching between data- and difference-view, the x-range doesn't change anymore.
FIXED musrt0 crash for histogram number out of range (MUSR-157)
FIXED fixes the inadequate attempt to use log max likelihood fit for asymmetry/non-muSR fit (MUSR-148)
CHANGED less strict handling of empty FUNCTION block
CHANGED cosmetics in the y-labelling (MUSR-154)
CHANGED maximum possible run number for the use in msr2data to numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max() (MUSR-155)

musrfit 0.8.0 - changes since 0.7.0
===================================
NEW added y-range option to usr_fit_ranges in the PLOT block (MUSR-144).
NEW added the option to split a user function into a global and run-block related part (see MUSR-134). If the 
    global option is used, this can potentially increase the efficiency up to the number of run-blocks since 
    the time consuming calculations are done only once per changed parameter set. Examples where this approach
    is profitable are: Abrikosov vortex lattice fits, Nonlocal Meissner screening.
FIXED compilation of BMWlibs with gcc 3.x
FIXED hanging musrt0's should be eliminated now (MUSR-153)
FIXED wrong WARNING message for use_fit_ranges
FIXED bug in event handling leading to crash for non-muSR when switching between view and difference view
CHANGED improved y-range scaling for Fourier

musrfit 0.7.0 - changes since 0.6.0
===================================
NEW added FIT_RANGE RESET | start end | s1 e1 s2 e2 .. sN eN command to the COMMAND block
NEW added FIX/RELEASE/RESTORE minuit2 command to the COMMAND block 
NEW implemented more checks on the integrity of the msr-file
NEW [MUSRGUI/MUSREDIT] msr2data default option flags in musredit_startup.xml
NEW 'global fit' option for msr2data
NEW implementation of SCAN/CONTOURS/MNPLOT (MUSR-100)
NEW possibility to use sqrt() and pow(base, exponent) in the FUNCTIONS block
NEW grouping of histograms
NEW [MUSREDIT] port of musrgui (Qt3.x) to musredit (Qt4.6)
NEW [MUSRGUI] better handling of font changes, and adding the possibility to define default font and font size in musrgui_startup.xml (MUSR-105)
NEW RRF option for single histograms and asymmetry plot
NEW integration of a few external musrfit plug-ins into the standard build process (disabled by default, see log of svn rev 4313)
NEW default estimates for 'data' and 'background' entries in RUN blocks
NEW directory with some msr- and data-files for quick testing of new musrfit installations
NEW option to musrt0: the key 'T' will set the t0 cursor to the maximum of the histogram
FIXED chisq/maxLH labels in the statistics block are properly handled now (MUSR-148)
FIXED y-unzoom failure for musrt0 (MUSR-77)
FIXED fitting issue for boundaries none/none (MUSR-136)
FIXED formatting of the ASCII fit output file for long parameter names (MUSR-142)
FIXED time window frame bug in musrview (MUSR-138)
FIXED calculation of LF relaxation functions for big static widths (MUSR-139)
FIXED minor msr2msr issue concerning the statistic block
FIXED Abragam function
FIXED removed phase parameter in Fourier power plots (MUSR-116)
FIXED segmentation fault in musrview when pressing d-f-d (MUSR-115)
FIXED wrong 'fixed background feeding'
FIXED [MUSRGUI] system variable access bugs
FIXED bug in lifetimecorrection-plot (MUSR-123)
FIXED axis labeling in non-muSR-plot (MUSR-124)
FIXED non-muSR ascii export first point missing (MUSR-119)
FIXED handling of wrong run numbers in PLOT block (MUSR-121)
FIXED reading of MUD data files in 64-bit environments (at least for EM64T)
FIXED compilation with GCC 4.4/4.5
FIXED [MUSRGUI] problems if started with an msr-file from the command line which is not in the current directory (MUSR-117)
FIXED [MUSRGUI] calls to musrview, musrt0 and msr<->mlog when paths contain spaces, etc.
FIXED usage of signs in the FUNCTIONS block
FIXED difference of Fourier != Fourier of difference (MUSR-107)
FIXED handling such that the proper initial phase is fitted
FIXED segmentation fault if number of histograms is smaller as the specified histogram number (MUSR-110)
FIXED warning messages
FIXED db data tag reading error
FIXED usage of BOOST >= 1.38.0
FIXED the extraction of the time resolution for the mud data format, since MUD_getHistFsPerBin seems sometimes to return just crap.
CHANGED musredit: change into the msr-file directory before calling musrview. This is needed if userFcn's are using startup XMLs.
CHANGED musredit: improved file system watcher notification mechanism to prevent multiple user notifications.
CHANGED fit range decimal precision handling of PMsrHandler improved (MUSR-150 request). It is now
        handling up to 4 decimal places.
CHANGED musredit: now it is keeping the directory from which the last msr-file has been loaded. This directory is 
        used when a new open dialog is called.
CHANGED another attempt to get proper zooming/unzooming. This time I tried to disentangle the rather messy PMusrCanvas class.
        Most of the checks seems to work, though still for non-muSR style, musrview is crashing once in a while which seems to 
	come from root rather than musrview. I will try to investigate that on root macro level. 
CHANGED in root-5.27.04 the zooming/unzooming handling was modified which forced me to add some more code for 
        proper zooming/unzooming via 'u' key
CHANGED write the ROOT histogram of the correlation matrix to the output file as well as not only the graph
CHANGED allow case insensitive 'run' as first entry in a runlist-file as input to msr2data
CHANGED [MUSRGUI/MUSREDIT] '(Un)comment' is splitted into 'Comment' and 'Uncomment'
CHANGED handling for invalid MUSRFITPATH
CHANGED build process: checks for MINUIT2, disable static libraries, disable F77 checks
CHANGED stricter handling of ADDRUN (MUSR-106)
CHANGED ASCII export from musrview
CHANGED check for subsequent numbered parameters (MUSR-103)
CHANGED WKMFULLDATAPATH to MUSRFULLDATAPATH
UPDATED triumf mud file support. Now the mud source from triumf is officially published under LGPL
UPDATED source code documentation
UPDATED PSIBIN/MDU class from AA/AR

musrfit 0.6.0 - changes since 0.5.2

NEW support for reading PSI MDU-ASCII data files
NEW estimate of t0 for the case it is not present, neither in the msr-file nor in the data-file (MUSR-73).
FIXED 0/1 problem in data and background ranges
FIXED crash of musrfit in case no 'background' line is present in the RUN-block (MUSR-99)
FIXED bug with t0 handling in case of ADDRUN and missing t0's in the msr-file, but t0's present in the data file (MUSR-94)
FIXED 'unwanted empty line problem of mlog-files' (MUSR-95)
FIXED building of PSI-BIN library on MacOSX
FIXED severe memory leaks
FIXED bug in the spin glass function for negative times
CHANGED improved handling for musrt0
CHANGED musrfit_startup.xml, added ALC and LEM AFS paths to the default paths

CHANGED encapsulation of data structures in classes
REMOVED 'save db' support from musrview
