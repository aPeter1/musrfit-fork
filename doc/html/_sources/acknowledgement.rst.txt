**Bastian M. Wojek**
  I am very much indebted to BMW for his rigorous testing of ``musrfit``, his many useful suggestions, contributions, and for the 
  largest part of the user manual of ``musrfit`` which makes it accessible to a broader audience! Many thanks Bastian! 

**Uldis Locans**
  I am very much indebted to Uldis work on :ref:`DKS <setup-dks>` enabling the GPU support for ``musrfit``. His kind, calm, and 
  extremely competent way to deal with his projects as well as to deal with the chaos of physicists way to think is admirable. Many thanks Uldis!

**Zaher Salman**

**Robert Scheuermann**
  Thanks for his constant contructive input on ``musrfit``!
