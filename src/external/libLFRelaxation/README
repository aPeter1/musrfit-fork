Implementation of a userFcn-interface to Gaussian and Lorentzian static and dynamic LF relaxation functions.
At the moment this is a simple alternative implementation to the functions provided by musrfit itself.
Mostly, this effort should be regarded as a design study which is not really indended for production use.

If musrfit has been configured with --enable-BMWlibs the functions can be called as:

userFcn  libLFRelaxation TLFStatGssKT 1 2       (frequency rate)
userFcn  libLFRelaxation TLFStatExpKT 1 2       (frequency rate)
userFcn  libLFRelaxation TLFDynGssKT  1 2 3     (frequency rate fluct.rate)
userFcn  libLFRelaxation TLFDynExpKT  1 2 3     (frequency rate fluct.rate)
userFcn  libLFRelaxation TLFDynSG     1 2 3     (frequency rate fluct.rate)
