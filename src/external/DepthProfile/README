Muon implantation experiments in films: obtaining depth-resolved information
Review of Scientific Instruments. 2020; 91(2): 023906 (7 pp.).

A few words about the details of the current implementation:

1) In order to handle the necessary rge-files (trim.sp stopping profiles), a
   file depth_profile_startup.xml has to be present in the working directory.
   In this xml-file the path to the rge-files and its energies are described.
   Details about the xml startup file can be found here:
   http://lmu.web.psi.ch/musrfit/user/html/user-manual.html#rge-file-handler-for-low-energy-mgrsr
   
2) For all these models, rather than the rge-files, the normalized cumulative 
   frequency distributions, i.e. cfd[i] = sum_{k=0}^i rge[k] / sum_{k=0}^max rge[k]
   are needed. Hence the cfd's are calculated in the constructor and used
   throughout afterwards.
 
3) under ./test you will find one example. 
   
4) Under <musrfit>/doc/example/DepthProfiles, where <musrfit> is the home
   directory of musrfit, you will find a couple more examples.
