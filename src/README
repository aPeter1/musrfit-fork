The following programs are available:

1) msr2msr
2) musrfit

which will be described below (including build instructions).

*************
1) msr2msr
*************

The original msr-files used in WKM (wkmfit, wkmview, ...) do have some shortcomings, hence it was necessary to slightly change the file format of these msr-files and hence sacrify the backwards compatibility. In order to be able to use old wkm-files, msr2msr was written. This program takes an old msr-file and converts it to a new one. If a new msr-file is fed to msr2msr, the output will be just a mere copy of the file, and hence it doesn't harm. This means, whenever you are not sure if the given msr-file is a new or and old one, just execute msr2msr.

usage: msr2msr <msr-file-in> <msr-file-out> | [--help]
  <msr-file-in> : input msr-file
  <msr-file-out>: converted msr-output-file

Build Instructions:
-------------------

make -f Makefile.msr2msr
make -f Makefile.msr2msr install

*************
1) musrfit
*************

musrfit is the first program in a series to be written which will be a full replacement for the corresponding WKM programs, e.g. wkmfit -> musrfit, etc.

Build Instructions:
-------------------

In order to get musrfit compiled, you need first to build the shared library libPMusr.so. In order to do so, please follow the instruction given in the file classes/BUILD.

make -f Makefile.musrfit
make -f Makefile.musrfit install

If it doesn't work for linux, try to set first

export OSTYPE=linux

for some shells this is needed but I have no clue why it is NOT recognised automatically ...
