---------------------
short term:
---------------------

* dump data and theory after fit (ascii/root): **DONE** for now
    done for ascii/root asymmetry && single histo: all the rest is missing
* migrate all typedef's and defines -> PMusr.h **DONE**

* Since rootcint cannot handle the spirit include files I will try to remove all the
  root dictionary related stuff since almost for sure, nobody will use the classes
  from the cint interpreter level 2007/12/27 **DONE**

* begin with the implementation of the FUNCTIONS block
  using the spirit parser framework **DONE**

* 2007/12/30: implement functions in PTheory **DONE** 08-01-02

* 2008/01/02: nice function block output needed. **DONE** 08-01-02

* write a little standalone program which is converting the old msr-files to 
  the new ones. **DONE** 08-01-04

* implement max.likelihood fits **DONE** 08-02-06 (for Single Histo only.
  For the others not clear how to do it.)

* fix problems in FUNCTIONS of the form (sin(par1)) **DONE** 08-02-18

* fix output problems of the mlog files **DONE** 08-02-22

* if a parameter is not used at all, minuit is still varying it!! This is stupid.
  Check the minuit manual, there must be a function to "remove" these parameters,
  i.e. forcing minuit to ignore them. checked the manual: use fix() (see p.31)
  **DONE** 08-03-10

* implement table based theory functions (LF stuff)
  static GKT LF **DONE** 08-03-12

* check midas keyboard routines for the usability

  system.c
  while (ss_kbhit()) {
      ch = ss_getchar(0);
      if (ch == -1)
        ch = getchar();

      if (ch == '!')
        status = RPC_SHUTDOWN;
  }


---------------------
intermediate term:
---------------------

* start writing docu, i.e. transferring WKM doc from German -> English and
  describe new features with examples!
* introduce error numbers with corresponding docu/explanation in the latex-docu.  
* implement RRF stuff
* implement NonMuSR stuff
* implement access to user-function, i.e. functions not
  defined within musrfit, using the ROOT dictionary feature
  to look for them and use them.
* think about if it is worth to modify wkm in order to read
  the new msr-files, so that wkmview can be used for an intermediate
  time.

---------------------
long term:
---------------------

* implement ROOT based wkmview, i.e. all the graphical stuff needed
  including event handler, etc.
* implement FFT with msr-interface
* switch from qmake to cmake

---------------------
problems:
---------------------
* rootcint cannot handle spirit framework includes, hence FUNCTIONS related stuff cannot be included
  into a root dictionary.

---------------------
fixes:
---------------------
* Needed to change some part of the Minuit2 source code, otherwise I got a strange linker error message.
  In MnMinos.h the constructors (3 overloaded versions) are defined implicitly. When linking against libPMusr.so
  which is using libMinuit2Base.so, I got the error message from the linker that is cannot find the reference
  to the second constructor. When transferring the implicit definition from the header file to the cxx, the
  problem was gone. Since to fiddle in the Minuit2 source code directly is ugly, I should look for a way to
  build libPMusr.so which doesn't have this problem.
  
  -> This problem has been resolved cleanly by using minuit2 delivered with root!
