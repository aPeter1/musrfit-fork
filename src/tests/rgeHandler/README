The rge handler expects a xml-input-file which is used to identify where to 
find the necessary rge-files, their names and energies. The relevant xml-tags
are:

<data_path>   : path to the place of the rge-files.

The rge-files naming has the structure <pre><energy>.rge, where <pre> is a
sensible string characterizing the material, e.g. 'SiC_E'. The '_E' is needed
by convention. <energy> is the value of the implantation energy in (eV), e.g.
1000. This information has to be provided in the xml-file in the following way:

<rge_fln_pre> : is the <pre> of the rge-file name.

Typically one is working with a set of energies. This energy list can be 
provided in two different ways:

(i) as an list of energies

    <energy_list>
       <energy>1000</energy>
       <energy>2000</energy>
       <energy>3000</energy>
       <energy>4500</energy>
       ....
    </energy_list>

of, in case the energy are equally stepped by

(ii) an energy vector

    <energy_vect start="1000" stop="22000" step="1000"/>

This would try to read all rge-files with energies starting from 1000 (eV)
up to 22000 (eV) in steps of 1000 (eV).
