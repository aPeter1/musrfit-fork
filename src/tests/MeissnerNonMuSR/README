This is a simple example for a Meissner screening user function for non-muSR input for musrfit.

It is very simple and has the following parameters:

1. field, i.e. external field value
2. thickness
3. dead layer thickness
4. lambda_ab

The following function are needed to geht the needed ROOT shared library:

Makefile.PMeissnerNonMuSR
PMeissnerNonMuSR.cpp
PMeissnerNonMuSR.h
PMeissnerNonMuSRLinkDef.h  <- this header is needed to generate the dictionary stub

The following files are examples how to generate the needed parameter input files, and how
to analyze it

runlist.txt         <- used together with msr2data to add the zMean data into the db-file
YBCO-Meissner.db    <- db-file generate with msr2data by using runlist.txt
YBCO-Meissner.msr   <- msr-file used to fit B versus zMean
