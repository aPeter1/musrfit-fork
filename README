musrfit - muSR and beta-NMR data analysis package

Contents
--------

This is a data analysis package to analyze time differential muSR and beta-NMR data. 
Currently it allows the following:

* set up most commonly used fitting functions for muSR and beta-NMR
* fit data, including global fits
* show the fit results and the residuals
* show the Fourier transform of the data
* easily extract the fit parameters and import in other programs (gnuplot, qtiplot/origin, ...)
* generate input fitting files for follow-up runs
* generate global input fitting files based on a single run template
* implement more sophisticated user functions 
  (e.g. GL vortex lattice, Meissner screening including low-energy muon stopping profiles)

Currently supported platforms
-----------------------------

* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Windows 10 1809 or newer - current state is for the commited ones
* Web based implementation - http://musruser.psi.ch/cgi-bin/musrfit.cgi
